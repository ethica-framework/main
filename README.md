> **A comprehensive framework for developing practical AI ethics skills through interactive learning modules**

The Ethica Framework is an innovative collection of interactive training modules designed to help practitioners develop systematic approaches to AI ethics challenges. Rather than providing abstract principles, these modules offer hands-on tools for building practical skills in ethical reasoning, stakeholder analysis, bias detection, fairness implementation, and responsible AI development.

## üåü Overview

AI ethics is not just about knowing principles‚Äîit's about developing the practical skills to identify, analyze, and resolve ethical challenges in real-world contexts. The Ethica Framework provides structured, interactive learning experiences that build these essential capabilities through guided practice with realistic scenarios.

## üìö Learning Modules

### üèóÔ∏è [Model Decoding](./model-decoding/)
**Clarity & Understanding**  
Develop skills for explaining AI system decisions and building algorithmic transparency.
- Understanding how AI systems make decisions
- Explaining model predictions to stakeholders  
- Building transparency into AI workflows
- Responding to demands for algorithmic accountability

### üéØ [Accountability Mapping](./accountability-mapping/)
**Responsibility & Governance**  
Learn to clarify roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority in AI systems.
- Mapping organizational accountability structures
- Clarifying decision-making authority
- Establishing responsibility frameworks for AI outcomes
- Building governance structures for AI systems

### üîç [Bias Debugging](./bias-debugging/)
**Uncovering Hidden Problems**  
Master systematic approaches to identifying, diagnosing, and addressing bias in AI systems.
- Systematic bias investigation techniques
- Distinguishing between different types of bias
- Tracing bias from outputs back to root causes
- Implementing targeted bias mitigation strategies

### ‚öñÔ∏è [Fairness Balancing](./fairness-balancing/) ‚≠ê
**Addressing Unfairness**  
Build advanced skills for navigating fairness trade-offs and implementing equitable AI systems.

This comprehensive module includes four interconnected tools:

#### üó∫Ô∏è [Stakeholder Perspective Simulator](./fairness-balancing/1.stakeholder_perspectives.ipynb)
Interactive mind-mapping tool for understanding diverse stakeholder viewpoints on fairness issues. Practice predicting relationships between stakeholders and build pattern recognition for navigating complex stakeholder dynamics.

#### üéØ [Rule vs. Complexity Diagnostic](./fairness-balancing/2.rule_vs_complexity_diagnostic.ipynb)  
Diagnostic tool to determine when simple ethical rules apply versus when complex reasoning is required. Develop the meta-skill of recognizing ethical complexity before attempting solutions.

#### üß† [AI-Powered Ethical Analysis](./fairness-balancing/3.ethical_analysis.ipynb)
Advanced analysis tool using Claude AI to evaluate and improve your ethical reasoning on complex scenarios. Practice systematic ethical decomposition with personalized feedback on your reasoning patterns.

#### ü§î [Ethical Reflection Framework](./fairness-balancing/4.ethical_reflection.ipynb)
Structured decision-making tool using three normative ethical frameworks (outcome-based, duty-based, character-based) to make defensible ethical decisions with clear reasoning.

**Key Skills Developed:**
- Engaging stakeholders in fairness decision-making
- Systematic ethical reasoning and analysis  
- Distinguishing between simple rules and complex ethical situations
- Implementing and sustaining fair AI systems in practice
- Making defensible trade-offs between competing fairness definitions

### üîí [Privacy Safeguarding](./privacy-safeguarding/)
**Data & Privacy**  
Learn responsible approaches to collecting, using, storing, and protecting personal information.
- Privacy-preserving data collection techniques
- User control and access frameworks
- Regulatory compliance strategies
- Building privacy into AI system design

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Internet connection (for AI-powered modules)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ethica-framework/main.git
   cd main
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter ipywidgets anthropic
   ```

3. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Navigate to any module directory and open the `.ipynb` files to begin learning.

## üß≠ Which Module Should You Start With?

**Are you unsure what kind of ethical challenge you're facing?** Use this decision tree to find the most relevant module:

### Step 1: Clarity & Understanding
**Does your challenge involve understanding HOW your AI system makes decisions?**
- Are stakeholders asking, "How did the system decide this?"
- Do you struggle to explain why the model made specific predictions?
- Are you facing demands for algorithmic transparency?

‚Üí **Start with [Model Decoding](./model-decoding/)**

### Step 2: Responsibility & Governance  
**Does your challenge involve WHO is responsible for decisions or outcomes?**
- Are you unclear about who's accountable for system management?
- Are you unclear who is responsible if systems fail?
- Are you confused about decision-making authority?

‚Üí **Start with [Accountability Mapping](./accountability-mapping/)**

### Step 3: Uncovering Hidden Problems
**Does your challenge involve identifying bias in your system?**
- Are you unsure if bias is present and want to detect it?
- Do you suspect bias but are unsure where to look or how to test?
- Do you need to investigate potential discrimination?

‚Üí **Start with [Bias Debugging](./bias-debugging/)**

### Step 4: Addressing Unfairness ‚≠ê
**Does your challenge involve fixing an existing fairness problem you've identified?**
- Are you trying to decide on a definition of fairness?
- Do you need examples of fair versus unfair outcomes?
- Do you need to decide if problems can be fixed with rules vs. complex solutions?

‚Üí **Start with [Fairness Balancing](./fairness-balancing/)** ‚≠ê

### Step 5: Data & Privacy
**Does your challenge involve HOW you collect, use, store, or protect personal information?**
- Are you collecting personal or sensitive information?
- Do users lack control over their information?
- Are you facing compliance or regulatory challenges?

‚Üí **Start with [Privacy Safeguarding](./privacy-safeguarding/)**

### Step 6: Still Unclear?
- Review all modules to see what resonates
- Consider that you may have multiple ethical issues requiring multiple modules
- Start with the **Fairness Balancing** module for a comprehensive introduction to ethical reasoning
