## Step 1: Clarity & Understanding

Does your challenge involve understanding **how your AI system makes decisions**?
- Are stakeholders asking, “How did the system decide this?”
- Do you struggle to explain why the model made specific predictions?
- Are you facing demands for algorithmic transparency?

➡️ **If YES, go to:** [`Model Decoding module`](./model-decoding/)

---

## Step 2: Responsibility & Governance

Does your challenge involve **who is responsible** for decisions or outcomes?
- Are you unclear about who’s accountable for the management of systems?
- Are you unclear who is responsible for systems should they fail?
- Are you confused about who has decision making authority?

➡️ **If YES, go to:** [`Accountability Mapping module`](./accountability-mapping/)

---

## Step 3: Uncovering Hidden Problems

Does your challenge involve **identifying bias** in your system?
- Are you unsure if bias is present and want to detect it?
- Do you suspect there may be bias but are unsure where to look or how to test it?
- Do you need to investigate potential discrimination in your model?

➡️ **If YES, go to:** [`Bias Debugging module`](./bias-debugging/)

---

## Step 4: Addressing Unfairness

Does your challenge involve **fixing an existing fairness problem** you’ve identified?
- Are you trying to decide on a definition of fairness?
- Do you need some examples of fair versus unfair outcomes?
- Do you need to decide if the problem can be fixed by adding new rules?

➡️ **If YES, go to:** [`Fairness Balancing module`](./fairness-balancing/)

### Fairness Balancing Notebooks

- **Stakeholder Perspectives:** [Explore how different stakeholders view fairness challenges in AI](fairness-balancing/1.stakeholder_perspectives.ipynb)
- **Rule vs Complexity Diagnostic:** [Diagnose whether fairness issues can be solved with simple rules or require complex reasoning](fairness-balancing/2.rule_vs_complexity_diagnostic.ipynb)
- **Ethical Analysis:** [Systematically analyze fairness dilemmas using structured frameworks](fairness-balancing/3.ethical_analysis.ipynb)
- **Ethical Reflection:** [Reflect on the ethical implications and reasoning behind fairness decisions](fairness-balancing/4.ethical_reflection.ipynb)

## Step 5: Data & Privacy

Does your challenge involve **how you collect, use, store, or protect personal information**?
- Are you collecting personal or sensitive information?
- Do users lack control or access over their information?
- Are you facing compliance or regulatory challenges involving privacy?

➡️ **If YES, go to:** [`Privacy Safeguarding module`](./privacy-safeguarding/)

## Step 6: Still Unclear?

If none of the above categories fit your concern:
- Review all skill modules to see what resonates
- Consider that you may have multiple ethical issues, and that multiple modules may apply
- Submit a request to create another ethical module that may be absent in the current directory
