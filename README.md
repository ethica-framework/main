**Are you unsure what kind of ethical challenge you’re facing? Do you have ethical concerns but can’t articulate them? Do you need help identifying the nature of your dilemma?**
If you answered YES to any of these questions, work through this decision tree:

**Step 1:** Clarity & Understanding
Does your challenge involve understanding HOW your AI system makes decisions?
-	Are stakeholders asking, “How did the system decide this?”
-	Do you struggle to explain why the model made specific predictions?
-	Are you facing demands for algorithmic transparency?
→ If YES, go to `Model Decoding module`

**Step 2:** Responsibility & Governance
Does your challenge involve WHO is responsible for decisions or outcomes?
-	Are you unclear about who’s accountable for the management of systems?
-	Are you unclear who is responsible for systems should they fail?
-	Are you confused about who has decision making authority?
→ If YES, go to `Accountability Mapping module`

**Step 3:** Uncovering Hidden Problems
Does your challenge involve identifying bias in your system?
-	Are you unsure if bias is present and want to detect it?
-	Do you suspect there may be bias but are unsure where to look or how to test it?
-	Do you need to investigate potential discrimination in your model?
→ If YES, go to `Bias Debugging module`

**Step 4:** Addressing Unfairness
Does your challenge involve fixing an existing fairness problem you’ve identified?
-	Are you trying to decide on a definition of fairness?
-	Do you need some examples of fair versus unfair outcomes?
-	Do you need to decide if the problem can be fixed by adding new rules? 
→ If YES, go to `Fairness Balancing module`

**Step 5:** Data & Privacy
Does your challenge involve HOW you collect, use, store, or protect personal information?
-	Are you collecting personal or sensitive information?
-	Do users lack control or access over their information?
-	Are you facing challenges in compliance or regulatory challenges involving privacy
→ If YES, go to `Privacy Safeguarding module`

**Step 6:** Still Unclear?
If none of the above categories fit your concern:
-	Review all skill modules to see what resonates
-	Consider that you may have multiple ethical issues, and that multiple modules may apply
-	Submit a request to create another ethical module that may be absent in the current directory
