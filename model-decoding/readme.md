**Model Decoding** </br> </br>
This module develops your capacity to make machine learning model behavior understandable and explainable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Model Decoding is the skill of translating complex, technical decision-making processes into clear, actionable insights that people can understand, trust, and act upon. Unlike basic model documentation (which describes what a model does), model decoding helps create the necessary transparency that aids in human understanding of AI systems and their impact on them. Below is a list of skills this module helps users build over time through repeated practice:
1. Choose appropriate explanation techniques for different audiences - Select explanation methods based on stakeholder needs, technical background, and decision context
2. Create meaningful AI transparency without overwhelming users - Balance comprehensiveness with clarity to provide practical understanding
3. Identify when and why explanations are needed - Recognize situations that require transparency versus those where it adds little value
4. Validate that explanations improve understanding - Test whether your transparency efforts genuinely help people make better decisions.
5. Implement practical explainability solutions by building transparency features that integrate effectively into real-world workflows and decision-making processes.
