**Accountability Mapping** </br> </br>
Accountability Mapping is the skill of identifying who is responsible for what decisions, when those responsibilities are triggered, and how accountability flows through complex organizational structures. Unlike simple org charts (which show reporting relationships), accountability mapping helps you create actionable responsibility frameworks that ensure ethical AI governance actually happens. Below is a list of skills this module helps users build over time through repeated practice:
1. Map decision points and responsibility chains - Identify where AI-related decisions are made and who has authority at each point
2. Distinguish between different types of accountability - Understand moral, legal, causal, and role-based responsibility
3. Anticipate accountability gaps before they cause problems - Recognize where responsibility is unclear or missing
4. Implement practical accountability mechanisms - Translate responsibility maps into actual processes, documentation, and oversight systems
