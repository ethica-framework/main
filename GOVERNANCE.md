## Project Mission & Scope

ETHICA Framework aims to provide an adaptive resource library for systematic ethical AI development. The project delivers interconnected tools, frameworks, workflows, and guidance to support diverse use cases and user contexts. Our mission is to enable responsible, transparent, and inclusive AI development practices.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Project Maintainers**: Guide overall project direction, review contributions, merge pull requests, and manage releases.
- **Contributors**: Anyone submitting issues, pull requests, documentation, or feedback.
- **Community Members**: Users and stakeholders who participate in discussions, test tools, or use project resources.

> Maintainers are listed in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file.

## Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus Seeking**: Major decisions are discussed publicly in issues or discussions. Consensus is preferred before changes are made.
- **Voting**: If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers may hold a simple majority vote.
- **Transparency**: All decisions, votes, and rationales are documented in the repository (e.g., via issues, PRs, or meeting notes).
