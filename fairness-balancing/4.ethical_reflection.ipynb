Users are guided through a series of questions and then prompted to decide on how to respond, along with the ethical reasoning that corresponds to one of three normative ethical theories: outcome-based, duty-based, or character-based. The user is then prompted to examine the consequences of their choices and compare them with alternative approaches. This develops the practical skill of making defensible, ethical decisions using structured reasoning frameworks aligned with normative ethical theories rather than relying on intuition alone."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"ezhibV82z8bi","cellView":"form"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title pip install\n","from IPython.display import clear_output\n","\n","!pip install ipywidgets\n","clear_output()  # Hides the output after the cell runs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"XB4H_1gy0CQM"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Imports\n","import random\n","import time\n","from IPython.display import display\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from ipywidgets import Button, VBox, HBox, HTML, Layout, RadioButtons, Textarea"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kQKB8jOK3qYF","cellView":"form"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Scenarios\n","scenarios = [\n","    {\n","        \"title\": \"Medical AI Accuracy Gap\",\n","        \"description\": \"Your diagnostic AI shows 92% accuracy for white patients and 78% accuracy for Black patients.
