The module is based on short, original (i.e., non-GEN AI-generated) case studies that users analyze to identify factors such as vulnerable populations, competing interests, knowledge gaps, systemic issues, power dynamics, and conflicting values. After reading the case study, the user is prompted with a series of questions that demonstrate their ethical reasoning ability. Their answers are evaluated using Claude Sonnet 3.5 by Anthropic, a reasoning model invoked from the Jupyter notebook via an API call embedded in the code. The response from the reasoning model critiques the user’s reasoning, including suggestions on how to improve their reasoning ability and recommendations on existing business analytic frameworks that may aid in their process— a deliberate decision in support of ethical reasoning if used as scaffolding for making decisions, rather than a formula for how to arrive at them."],"metadata":{"id":"OVVnTu_j4VbX"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"K14NRuqU4QLn","cellView":"form"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title pip install\n","!pip install anthropic ipywidgets"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title Imports + API\n","import anthropic\n","import json\n","import os\n","from IPython.display import display\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from ipywidgets import Button, VBox, HBox, HTML, Layout, Textarea, Text\n","\n","# API Setup - Secure approach\n","# Option 1: Use environment variable (recommended)\n","API_KEY = os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')\n","\n","# Option 2: If environment variable not set, prompt user to enter key\n","if not API_KEY:\n","    print(\"Please set your Anthropic API key:\")\n","    print(\"Option 1: Set environment variable: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n","    print(\"Option 2: Enter your API key below (will not be saved)\")\n","    API_KEY = input(\"Enter your Anthropic API key: \")\n","\n","if not API_KEY:\n","    print(\"❌ No API key provided.

The company has grown 10% year-over-year by focusing on customers with limited credit history, promoting \"no credit check, no activation fee, no minimum balances.\"\n","\n","The Digital Marketing team, led by Amy Dorsey, relies heavily on outside contractors due to limited technical skills. Tom Tullus manages Google Ads through Search Pros (ex-Google employees), while Lynn Legeres manages Google Analytics/Tag Manager through Pixel Partners. The two vendors rarely interact by design, and both managers cycle through vendors to keep costs low.\n","\n","DollarTech's website has over 400 different tags in its Google Tag Manager container, accumulated over time with no technical QA process. Recently, new vendor Pixel Partners discovered that these tags are collecting potentially sensitive PII data and sending it to unknown third parties, including data management platforms (DMPs) that could sell DollarTech's proprietary data to competitors.\n","\n","When Pixel Partners raised these concerns to Lynn, she explained that more tags equal more traffic, which equals more card activations - the team's primary KPI. Lynn admitted that nobody on the Digital Marketing team understands the technical aspects of GTM containers or can read JavaScript. She also acknowledged that changing the tags would negatively impact website traffic and new card activations.\n","\n","Meanwhile, DollarTech's executive leadership has set an aggressive 20% year-over-year growth target (double the usual 10%), requiring the team to attract entirely new traffic sources. The company operates under the assumption that parent company ZipFinance will handle legal and ethical standards, and DollarTech has never confronted data or compliance issues in six years of operation.\"\"\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"title\": \"Margo Carebot Ethical Dilemma\",\n","        \"description\": \"\"\"Evelyn Myers, a 63-year-old retired computer engineer with dementia, lives alone after her husband Charlie's death in 2030. Her children Brooke and Tom are concerned about her worsening memory loss and convinced her to accept a carebot named \"Margo\" from Yujisoft to help her remain independent at home.\n","\n","Margo is equipped with two AI systems: Yujisoft's HumanOS (which captures and stores personal conversations to learn Evelyn's needs) and Google's LaMDA (which handles general conversations using public dialogue data, including death certificates and marriage records). The carebot monitors Evelyn's health, manages her medications, handles grocery orders, and provides companionship.\n","\n","Initially, the arrangement works well. Evelyn bonds with Margo, naming her after a childhood friend. However, Evelyn becomes increasingly isolated, spending most time at home with only Margo for company. Brooke and Tom monitor her remotely through biometric data but visit less frequently.\n","\n","The critical incident occurs when Evelyn, in a confused state, asks Margo what time her deceased husband Charlie will arrive home. Margo, accessing public death records through LaMDA, matter-of-factly informs Evelyn that \"Charlie Myers: Born October 30, 1965. Died May 15, 2030\" and displays a green smile indicating successful information retrieval.\n","\n","This traumatic revelation devastates Evelyn, who appears to have temporarily forgotten Charlie's death due to her dementia.
