Using scenarios that test the boundaries between simple principles and nuanced reasoning, users practice the meta-skill of recognizing when straightforward ethical rules apply versus when deeper analysis is needed. Each scenario presents a fairness dilemma, asking users to choose between applying a simple rule or engaging in complex reasoning, with immediate feedback explaining the reasoning behind each choice. This develops the crucial ability to self-assess the complexity of ethical situations before attempting to solve them."],"metadata":{"id":"txQzEVJxccHk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title pip install\n","from IPython.display import clear_output\n","\n","!pip install ipywidgets\n","clear_output()  # Hides the output after the cell runs"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"_sPYcdTHz3o-","cellView":"form"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title Imports\n","import random\n","import time\n","from IPython.display import display\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from ipywidgets import Button, VBox, HBox, HTML, Layout, RadioButtons"],"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"qO2hs7ipz4_K"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title Scenarios\n","scenarios = [\n","    # SIMPLE RULE scenarios - clear principles apply\n","    {\n","        \"text\": \"Your hiring algorithm shows 95% accuracy for all demographic groups.
