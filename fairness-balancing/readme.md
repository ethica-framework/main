**Fairness Balancing** </br> </br>
This practice area develops your capacity to not only reason through fairness trade-offs systematically but also to implement and sustain fair AI systems in practice. Fairness Balancing is the skill of identifying issues that may cause individual or systematic harm and steering decisions towards more fair outcomes. Unlike bias detection (which finds problems), fairness balancing helps you make defensible decisions about resolving those problems and translating those decisions into effective action. Below is a list of skills this module helps users build over time through repeated practice:
1.	Engage stakeholders in fairness decision-making to solicit points of view on how the principle can be defined.
2.	Determine whether rule-based logic can be applied to overcome an ethical challenge or if the situation requires a more complex solution.
3.	Identify different indicators that may be present in ethically complex situations.
4.	Apply ethical reasoning to choose between competing approaches to fairness.
