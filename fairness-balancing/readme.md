This module develops your capacity to not only reason through fairness trade-offs systematically but to implement and sustain fair AI systems in practice. Fairness Balancing is the skill of identifying issues that may cause individual or systematic harm and steering decisions towards more fair outcomes. Unlike bias detection (which finds problems), fairness balancing helps you make defensible decisions about resolving those problems and translating those decisions into effective action. Below is a list of skills this module helps users build over time through repeated practice:

1.	Develop an intuition for “fair” versus “unfair” outcomes.
2.	Determine whether rule-based logic can be applied to overcome an ethical challenge, or if the situation requires a more complex solution.
3.	Recognize the different definitions of fairness, how they compare, and how they contrast.
4.	Apply ethical reasoning to choose between competing fairness approaches
5.	Engage stakeholders in fairness decision-making to solicit points of view on how the principle can be defined
