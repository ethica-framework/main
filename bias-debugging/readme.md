**Bias Debugging** </br> </br>
This module develops your capacity to systematically identify, diagnose, and address bias in AI systems using structured investigative approaches. Bias Debugging is the skill of methodically tracing bias to root causes, understanding how bias propagates through AI pipelines, and implementing targeted solutions or "fixes" to address the actual source of the problem. Unlike surface-level bias detection (which identifies that bias exists), bias debugging helps you understand why bias occurs and how to fix it effectively. Below is a list of skills this module helps users build over time through repeated practice:
1. Systematically investigate bias symptoms - Follow structured processes to trace bias from outputs back to sources.
2. Distinguish between different types of bias - Recognize data bias, algorithmic bias, measurement bias, and interpretation bias.
3. Analyze bias propagation through AI pipelines - Understand how bias compounds and transforms across data collection, training, and deployment.
4. Choose appropriate bias mitigation strategies - Select targeted interventions based on bias type and pipeline location.
5. Implement and validate bias fixes - Apply corrections and verify they solve the actual problem without creating new issues.
